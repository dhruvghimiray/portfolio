    greetings: "Hey! my name is",
  },
...
};

### Contact Form

For the contact form, you'll need to obtain your own Google OAuth Client ID:

1. Visit the Google Cloud Console.
2. Create a new project, or select an existing one.
3. Go to "APIs & Services" -> "Credentials".
4. Click on "Create Credentials" -> "OAuth client ID".
5. Choose "Web application", name it, and add `http://localhost:3000` in "Authorized JavaScript origins" and `http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback` in "Authorized redirect URIs".
6. Save it and copy the client ID to the .env.local file in the root directory of the project.
