          I&apos;m an enthusiastic Web Developer with a knack for building
          compelling websites and applications. I started my journey with HTML
          and CSS. I then learned Java and data structures before picking up web
          development again. I love to experiment an use different web
          technologies and make interactive and useful web apps
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I&apos;m familiar with many web technologies and have been able to
          gain valuable experience in different areas of web development such as
          front-end development. I love to use different technologies in my web
          app such as React.js, Next.js, React Router, and GSAP. I am excited to
          continue learning more about web development and exploring new
          technologies.

              In my current internship at Venuratech Solutions, I am serving as
              a web developer, where I am honing my expertise in HTML, CSS, and
              Javascript. Besides, as a novice in web development, I am
              enthusiastically seeking opportunities to gain hands-on experience
              in React.js, React Router, and GSAP. Engaging in real-life
              projects allows me to acquire indispensable skills in the field of
              web development.

              Additionally, as part of my web development responsibilities, my
              ongoing internship at Venuratech Solutions offers me the chance to
              work on projects involving advanced technologies. These practical
              experiences are significantly enriching my comprehension of web
              development. Overall, the internship continues to be an immensely
              valuable learning journey that expands both my knowledge and
              skills in this domain.
