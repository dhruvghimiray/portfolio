          I&apos;m an enthusiastic Web Developer with a knack for building compelling
          websites and applications. I started my journey with HTML and CSS. I then 
          learned Java and data structures before picking up web development 
          again. I love to experiment an use different web technologies
          and make interactive and useful web apps
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I&apos;m familiar with many web technologies and have been able to gain valuable 
          experience in different areas of web development such as front-end development. I 
          love to use different technologies in my web app such as React.js, Next.js, React 
          Router, and GSAP. I am excited to continue learning more about web development and 
          exploring new technologies.
