          I&apos;m a passionate Full Stack Developer and AI/ML enthusiast with a
          strong background in creating comprehensive web products. My journey
          began with HTML and CSS, and after delving into Java and data
          structures, I returned to web development with a newfound enthusiasm.
          My goal is to craft compelling and interactive web applications using
          a variety of technologies.

        <p>
          As a Full Stack Developer, I have hands-on experience with diverse web
          technologies. On the front-end, I specialize in using React.js,
          Next.js, React Router, and GSAP to build engaging user interfaces. For
          the backend, I am proficient in PHP and Laravel, a PHP framework, to
          create robust and scalable web solutions. Additionally, I leverage
          tools like React.js and Tailwind CSS to enhance the overall user
          experience of my web applications.
