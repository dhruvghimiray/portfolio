          I&apos;m an enthusiastic Web Developer with a knack for building compelling
          websites and applications. I started my journey with HTML and CSS. I then 
          learned Java and data structures before picking up web development 
          again. I love to experiment an use different web technologies
          and make interactive and useful web apps
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I&apos;m familiar with many web technologies and have been able to gain valuable 
          experience in different areas of web development such as front-end development. I 
          love to use different technologies in my web app such as React.js, Next.js, React 
          Router, and GSAP. I am excited to continue learning more about web development and 
          exploring new technologies.

              During my ongoing internship at Venuratech Solutions, I am currently working as a web
              developer and gaining experience in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Additionally, as a 
              beginner web developer, I am actively pursuing valuable experience in React.js, React
              Router, and GSAP. I am acquiring essential skills in web development and actively
              working on real-life projects.

            <p>  
              Furthermore, along with my web development responsibilities, I'm getting the 
              opportunity to work on developing projects using advanced technologies during 
              my internship at Venuratech Solutions. These hands-on experiences are allowing
              me to deepen my understanding of web development further. Overall, my ongoing
              internship continues to be a highly valuable learning experience that is expanding
              my knowledge and skills in the field.
